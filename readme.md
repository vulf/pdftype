# PDFTYPE
> Tired of typing interesting but not-so-helpful paragraphs while practicing touch typing? Want to type useful and relevant text from books?
A `curses` touch typing game which lets you practice with text / paragraphs from your favourite PDFs. Written in Python3.

## How does it work?
`pdftype` extracts a random paragraph from a PDF that you specify, and converts it into a touch typing practice game.

## Installation
Run the following commands:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/vulf/pdftype
$ cd pdftype/
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Specifying a PDF
Specify the location of the PDF file in `file_loc`

## TODO
- [ ] Fix ligatures
- [ ] Include all paragraphs in a page in the randomization process
